# Computational-linear-algebra
Matlab/Otave code. In this repository we find solutions for the different methods of the computational linear algebra discipline applied to the tri-diagonal matrix system generated by the Crankâ€“Nicolson method applied to the one-dimensional diffusion equation will be solved. 
The methods inpleented here are: 
Gaussian elimination, with and without pivot. 
LU decomposition. 
Cholesky decomposition. 
Matrix inversion. 
And their respective runtimes.

The scalar equation of diffusion is very important and very studied, any problem involving diffusion goes through it, so solving this equation as accurately as possible is very important. It is in this contest that implicit methods enter and play a fundamental role in obtaining  consistent solutions in all points of the mesh.

Tutorial for rum:
call: rum_principal(method) 
where method can be equal: LU, Ge, GeP, cho, inv for exemple:
rum_principal('inv')
