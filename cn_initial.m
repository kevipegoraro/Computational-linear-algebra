% The scalar equation of diffusion is very important and very studied, any problem involving 
% diffusion goes through it, so solving this equation as accurately as possible is very important. 
% It is in this contest that implicit methods enter and play a fundamental role in obtaining 
% consistent solutions in all points of the mesh.

% Below you can freely change the simulation data, or even modify 
% the method to solve any system of linear equations you want.
